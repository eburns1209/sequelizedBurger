# sequelizedBurger
In this assignment, I Sequelized the Burger app that I made last week. First, I removed all references to my vanilla MySQL queries and replaced them with Sequelized queries. 

I replaced the Burger model with a Sequelized equivalent. I also initialize the migration file ot make the burger's devoured field carrry a default value of false. 

My finish product works just like the burger app.
